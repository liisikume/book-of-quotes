# book-of-quotes

This is a script for creating a database of quotes that can be modified to different types of databases, e.g. movies, music.

It was created to practice the use of classes, dataclasses, static methods, regular expressions, and data input by the user. In general, the first part of the script, i.e. the name and email part, is not necessary, but for the sake of practice, it was added.

The python files contains the script for entering, deleting, modifying, and searching quotes. The .txt file already contains a certain amount of quotes as examples. In case the .txt file is missing when running the script, a new, empty file will be created and the quote will be added there.
